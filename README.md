# Newt+ (Enhanced Vanilla)

[![Mod List][badge-mods]][file-mods]

**A modern, performance-first client-side modpack for Minecraft 1.21.5 and beyond.**

Newt+ (Enhanced Vanilla) is the updated continuation of the original *Newt+ (Sodium Edition)* â€” now rebuilt for the latest version of Minecraft and centered around cutting-edge performance, visual upgrades, and quality-of-life improvements. Designed for **Fabric**, this pack is lightweight, modular, and optimized for the best possible vanilla+ experience.

## âš¡ Performance Over Everything

Newt+ is **faster than OptiFine** thanks to powerful optimization mods like:

- **Sodium** â€“ blazing-fast rendering
- **Lithium** â€“ optimized game logic
- **Entity Culling** â€“ reduces FPS drops around mobs

Together, these mods make Minecraft smoother, more responsive, and less hardware-intensive â€” perfect for both low- and high-end systems.

## ðŸŒˆ OptiFine Parity â€” Without the Headaches

OptiFine is no longer required. Newt+ includes modern alternatives that replicate or exceed most of its features:

- âœ… Dynamic Lights  
- âœ… Connected Textures
- âœ… Zoom Key
- âœ… Shader Support
- âœ… Smooth Transitions and Animations  

No more waiting on OptiFine updates â€” this pack works *now* and plays nice with other mods.

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual & UI Enhancements

Newt+ enhances the look and feel of Minecraft while preserving its iconic aesthetic:

- Subtle UI improvements  
- Shader compatibility via Iris  
- Visual bugfixes and polish  

## ðŸ§° Quality-of-Life Features

Built to reduce tedium and streamline your experience:

- Inventory sorting and tweaks  
- Coordinate HUDs  
- Tooltips with useful info  

Everything is **client-side** and works on vanilla or lightly modded servers.

## ðŸª¡ Built on Fabric

Fabric is fast, lightweight, and future-ready. It enables Newt+ to deliver frequent updates, strong mod support, and low overhead â€” unlike bulkier mod loaders.

## ðŸŽ¯ Who Should Use This?

- Players who want vanilla+, not full modded gameplay  
- Performance lovers looking to maximize FPS  

## âœ… Multiplayer Friendly

All mods in Newt+ are **client-side only**. That means you can:

- Join any vanilla or Fabric server  
- Play solo or multiplayer  
- Use the modpack without needing to install anything on the server

**Install Newt+ (Enhanced Vanilla)** and enjoy a faster, cleaner, smarter Minecraft â€” the way vanilla *should* feel :)
